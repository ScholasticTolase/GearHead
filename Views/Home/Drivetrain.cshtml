        <h3>The Drive Train</h3>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The drive train transmits the power of the engine to the drive wheels. The drive train includes the transmission, drive shafts and other various parts</p>
            <p> A clutch (manual transmission) or torque converter (automatic transmission) allows the drive train to be disconnected from the engine so that the vehicle may be brought to a stand still without having to stop the engine.</p>

            The drive train consists of any number of the following items.
            <ul>
                <li> A Clutch or Torque Converter</li>
                <li>A Transmission and Differential</li>
                <li>A Series of Drive Shafts</li>
            </ul>
            <p> A clutch is used with a manual transmission while a torque converter is used with an automatic transmission. The clutch is operated through the use of a foot pedal and is controlled by the driver. When the clutch is engaged the engine is connected to the transmission, when the clutch is disengaged the engine can continue to run even though the vehicle maybe at a stand still.</p>
            <p> A torque converter engages and disengages itself depending on the speed of the engine. A torque converter is a fluid coupling and is divided into two (2) halves. Fluid pressure in one half of the torque converter generated by the speed of the engine forces the other half of the torque converter to begin turning. The vehicle speed increases until the two (2) halves are turning at the same speed. When the engine is slowly running (idling) at about 1,000 R.P.M. (revolutions per minute) the vehicle can be held at a stand still however as the engine speed is increased the vehicle begins to move.</p>
            <p>A transmission or gear box is used to provide the driver with different speeds through the use of a series of gears. An automatic transmission changes gears on its own while the gears of a manual transmission must be changed by the driver. Like the gears on a bicycle the driver selects the appropriate gear for the road. When the bicycle is stationary the large sprocket on the back wheel provides the rider with enough torque to get the bicycle moving without too much effort on the rider’s part however the bicycle does not move very fast. Once the bicycle is in motion, the rider selects the next smaller sprocket. This allows the rider to gain more speed without any extra effort. As the bicycle moves fast the rider continues to select the next smaller sprocket until the chain is on the smallest sprocket (top speed). As the bicycle is slowing down the rider must reverse the process and start moving towards the larger sprocket until the chain is on the largest sprocket and the bicycle is stopped once again.</p>
            <p>The drive shafts connect the transmission and/or differential(s) to the drive wheels depending on if the vehicle is front wheel drive, rear wheel drive or 4-wheel drive. For front wheel drive the transmission and differential are combined in a single unit called a transaxle and therefore there are only two (2) drive shafts needed, one for the left wheel and one for the right. With rear wheel drive there are three (3) drive shafts necessary, one main drive shaft connects the transmission to the differential at the rear of the vehicle and the other two (2) shafts connect to the left and right drive wheels. 4-wheel drive usually requires a transfer case, two (2) differentials and six (6) drive shafts. The transfer case is mounted on to the transmission with two (2) of the drive shafts connected to it, one for the front wheels and one for the rear. These drive shafts then connect to a differential which then feeds the corresponding drive wheels.</p>
